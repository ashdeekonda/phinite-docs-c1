# About Phinite

Phinite is an AI automation platform to build, orchestrate, and deploy lifelike assistants and intelligent multi-agent workflows — across channels, tools, and business processes.

Whether you're replacing a call center agent, automating report generation, or deploying assistants that act autonomously, Phinite gives your team the tools to build and run AI systems at scale — safely and visually.

---

## What You Can Do with Phinite

Teams use Phinite to:

- Design agent workflows visually in the Flowgen Studio
- Build tools and connectors using DevStudio
- Deploy across environments with version control and observability
- Power assistants with knowledge bases, prompt engineering, and tools
- Track sessions, model usage, and decisions using detailed logs

## Core Concepts

| Concept           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Assistant**     | A conversational, email-based, or autonomous agent powered by one or more flows |
| **Flow**          | A visual decision graph with nodes that orchestrate logic, tools, and conversations |
| **Node**          | The building block of a flow — can prompt a model, call a tool, capture input, or make decisions |
| **Tool**          | A callable API, function, or system integration used by your assistant |
| **Trigger**       | Defines how an assistant is invoked (e.g., voice call, webhook, calendar event) |
| **Environment**   | Isolated stages like Dev, UAT, or Production — with separate assistants, logs, and usage caps |
| **Session**       | A full execution of a flow, recorded in logs with inputs, decisions, outputs, and metrics |

## Who Uses Phinite

Phinite supports a multi-role collaboration model so your entire team can work together:

| Role       | Responsibilities |
|------------|------------------|
| **Developers**   | Build tools, wire integrations, and design flows |
| **Architects**   | Plan agent logic, manage flows, and configure environments |
| **Admins**       | Control access, invite users, and manage billing and environments |
| **Testers**      | Validate assistant behavior and run debug sessions |
| **Analysts**     | Observe sessions, track model usage, and monitor outcomes |
