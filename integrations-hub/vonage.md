## Overview

Phinite's **Vonage** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Vonage APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Send SMS and multi-channel messages, run phone verification (OTP) and number insight lookups, and manage account balance and virtual numbers via the Vonage (Nexmo) APIs.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
