## Overview

Phinite's **Azure Blob Storage** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Azure Blob Storage APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Azure Blob Storage containers and blobs via the Azure Blob Storage REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

## Required credentials

- Tenant ID `tenant_id` (required)
- Client ID `client_id` (required)
- Client Secret `client_secret` (required)
- Storage Account `storage_account` (required)

## Setup steps

1. Create a Storage Account in the Azure Portal.
2. Copy the account name and access key (or configure a service principal for OAuth).
3. Log into your Phinite workspace at app.phinite.ai
4. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Predefined tools**
5. Select **Azure Blob Storage**
6. Click **+ Add Configuration**
7. Enter the credential fields listed above
8. Select assistants that should use this connection
9. Click **Save Configuration**

## Configure in Graph Studio

1. Open an agent in Graph Studio
2. Select the agent node → **Tools** tab → **Add a new tool**
3. Choose **AzureBlobTool** (or search for Azure Blob Storage)
4. Select your saved connection or add a new one
5. Enable the subtools your workflow needs and save

## Predefined tools

Phinite provides 8 subtools for Azure Blob Storage:

- Create Container: Creates a new blob container in the storage account.
- Delete Container: Deletes a blob container and all blobs it contains. Irreversible.
- Get Container: Returns properties and metadata of a blob container.
- List Containers: Lists all blob containers in the storage account.
- Upload Blob: Uploads a blob from a URL source or from plain text/JSON content.
- Delete Blob: Deletes a blob from a container.
- Download Blob: Downloads a blob's content. Text/JSON blobs are returned as a string; binary blobs as base64.
- List Blobs: Lists blobs in a container, optionally filtered by prefix.

## Documentation & resources

- Official documentation: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/`
- Phinite documentation: [Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.phinite.ai/docs/integrations-hub/azure-blob)

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
