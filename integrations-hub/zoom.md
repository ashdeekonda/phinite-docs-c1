## Overview

Phinite's **Zoom** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Zoom APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Zoom meetings, users, webinars, cloud recordings, chat channels/messages, and past-meeting participants via the Zoom REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
