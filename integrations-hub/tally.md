## Overview

Phinite's **Tally** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Tally APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Tally forms, submissions, webhooks, workspaces, and organization members via the Tally REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
