## Overview

Phinite's **Insightly** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Insightly APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Insightly CRM records — contacts, organisations, leads, opportunities, projects, tasks, and events — via the Insightly REST API v3.1.

Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).
