## Overview

Phinite's **Gorgias** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Gorgias APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Gorgias helpdesk resources — tickets, ticket messages, customers, users, tags, and views — via the Gorgias REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

## Required credentials

- Subdomain `subdomain` (required)
- Account Email `email` (required)
- API Key `api_key` (required)
- Base URL `base_url` (optional)

## Setup steps

1. Create a Gorgias account and sign in at app.gorgias.com.
2. Go to **Settings → REST API** and create an API key.
3. Note your Gorgias subdomain, account email, and API key.
4. Verify with a users API call using basic auth (`email:api_key`).
5. Log into your Phinite workspace at app.phinite.ai
6. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Predefined tools**
7. Select **Gorgias**
8. Click **+ Add Configuration**
9. Enter the credential fields listed above

## Configure in Graph Studio

1. Open an agent in Graph Studio
2. Select the agent node → **Tools** tab → **Add a new tool**
3. Choose **GorgiasTool** (or search for Gorgias)
4. Select your saved connection or add a new one
5. Enable the subtools your workflow needs and save

## Predefined tools

- Create Ticket: Creates a ticket. The fields map must include a customer and a non-empty messages array.
- Get Ticket: Fetches a single ticket by ID.
- List Tickets: Lists tickets (cursor-paginated). Filter by customer_id, external_id, view_id, or rule_id only.

- Delete Ticket: Permanently deletes a ticket by ID.
- Create Message: Adds a message to a ticket (agent reply or internal note).
- List Messages: Lists the messages on a ticket (cursor-paginated).
- Create Customer: Creates a customer. Provide a name and/or email.
- Get Customer: Fetches a single customer by ID.
- List Customers: Lists/searches customers (cursor-paginated). Filter by email or external_id.
- Update Customer: Updates a customer's fields (e.g. name, language, timezone, data).
- Get User: Fetches a single user (agent) by ID.
- List Users: Lists users (agents) (cursor-paginated).

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
