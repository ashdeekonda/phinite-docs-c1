## Overview

Phinite's **Zoho Desk** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Zoho Desk APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Zoho Desk help-desk tickets, comments, contacts, accounts, agents, departments, and knowledge-base articles via the Zoho Desk REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
