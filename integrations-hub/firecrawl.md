## Overview

Phinite's **Firecrawl** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Firecrawl APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Scrape pages into clean markdown, crawl domains, extract structured

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).

Phinite provides 8 subtools for Firecrawl:

- Scrape: Scrape a single URL and convert it to markdown, HTML, or other formats.
- Crawl: Crawl a website starting from a URL. Blocks until completion and returns
- Start Crawl: Start a crawl job without waiting. Returns a job ID that can be used
- Get Crawl Status: Check the status of a crawl job by its ID.
- Cancel Crawl: Cancel a running crawl job by its ID.
- Map Website: Generate a list of URLs from a website. Useful for getting a site structure
- Batch Scrape: Scrape multiple URLs in batch. Blocks until completion and returns

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
