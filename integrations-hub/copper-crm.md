## Overview

Phinite's **Copper CRM** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Copper CRM APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage a Copper CRM account — people, companies, leads, opportunities, tasks, projects, activities, plus account/config lookups — via the Copper REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
