## Overview

Phinite's **ActiveCampaign** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call ActiveCampaign APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage an ActiveCampaign account — contacts, tags, lists, deals, accounts, plus contact-tag/list associations and custom fields via the ActiveCampaign v3 API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).
