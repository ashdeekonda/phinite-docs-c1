## Overview

Phinite's **SendGrid** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call SendGrid APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Send emails, manage contacts and lists, create single sends, retrieve templates, handle suppressions, and view stats via the SendGrid API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).

- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
