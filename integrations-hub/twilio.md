## Overview

Phinite's **Twilio** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Twilio APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Send SMS/MMS, make voice calls, manage recordings, accounts, phone numbers, conferences, and Conversations via the Twilio REST API.

Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
