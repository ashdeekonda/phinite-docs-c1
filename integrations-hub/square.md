## Overview

Phinite's **Square** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Square APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Square payments, refunds, orders, catalog, customers, cards, invoices, payment links, subscriptions, inventory, and locations via the Square API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
