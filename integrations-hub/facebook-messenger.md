## Overview

Phinite's **Facebook Messenger** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Facebook Messenger APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Send messages and manage a Facebook Messenger bot via the Messenger Platform — text, attachments, quick replies, templates, sender actions, user profile, Messenger Profile config, and handover protocol.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).

- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
