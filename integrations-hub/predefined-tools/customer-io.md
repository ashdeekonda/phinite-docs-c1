## Overview

Phinite's **Customer.io** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Customer.io APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Customer.io people, events, devices, segments, campaigns, transactional messages, and message history via the Track and App APIs.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/integrations-hub/predefined-tools/workflow).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

5. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Predefined tools**
6. Select **Customer.io**
7. Click **+ Add Configuration**
8. Enter the credential fields listed above
9. Select assistants that should use this connection
10. Click **Save Configuration**

## Configure in Graph Studio

1. Open an agent in Graph Studio
2. Select the agent node → **Tools** tab → **Add a new tool**
3. Choose **CustomerIoTool** (or search for Customer.io)
4. Select your saved connection or add a new one
5. Enable the subtools your workflow needs and save

## Predefined tools

Phinite provides 24 subtools for Customer.io:

- Identify Customer: Creates or updates a person (upsert) with attributes. Merge semantics; a null attribute value deletes it.
- Delete Customer: Deletes a person and their associated data.
- Suppress Customer: Suppresses a person — deletes their profile and stops all messaging to them.
- Unsuppress Customer: Removes a person from the suppression list, allowing messaging to resume.
- Track Event: Tracks an event for a known person. Can trigger campaigns and is recorded on the person's activity timeline.
- Track Anonymous Event: Tracks an event not yet tied to a known person, identified by an anonymous_id.
- Track Page View: Records a page view for a known person (an event with type='page').
- Add Device: Adds or updates a push device (token + platform) for a person.
- Delete Device: Removes a push device from a person.
- Merge Customers: Merges two people; the primary survives and the secondary is deleted, with its data folded in.
- Add To Segment: Adds people to a manual segment (max 1000 IDs per call).
- Remove From Segment: Removes people from a manual segment (max 1000 IDs per call).
- Get Campaign: Retrieves a single campaign by ID.
- List Campaigns: Lists all campaigns in the workspace.
- Get Campaign Metrics: Retrieves delivery metrics for a campaign over a period.
- Trigger Broadcast: Triggers an API-triggered broadcast campaign. Only API-triggered broadcasts can be triggered.
- Send Transactional Email: Sends a transactional email using a transactional message template.
- Send Transactional Push: Sends a transactional push notification using a transactional push template.
- List Segments: Lists all segments in the workspace.
- Get Segment: Retrieves a single segment by ID.
- Create Manual Segment: Creates a manual segment that people can be added to or removed from via the Track API.
- Delete Segment: Deletes a segment by ID.
- Get Customer Attributes: Retrieves a person's stored attributes via the App API.
- List Messages: Lists message-delivery history for the workspace with optional filters.

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
