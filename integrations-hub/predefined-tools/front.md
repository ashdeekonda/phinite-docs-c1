## Overview

Phinite's **Front** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Front APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Front shared-inbox communication — conversations, messages and replies, contacts, inboxes, channels, teammates, tags, comments, and drafts — via the Front Core API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/integrations-hub/predefined-tools/workflow).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio
