## Overview

Phinite's **Freshsales CRM** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Freshsales CRM APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Freshsales CRM contacts, accounts, deals, notes, tasks, and perform search via the Freshsales REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/integrations-hub/predefined-tools/workflow).
