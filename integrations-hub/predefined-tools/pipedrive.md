## Overview

Phinite's **Pipedrive** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Pipedrive APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Pipedrive CRM deals, persons, organizations, activities, notes, pipelines, leads, products, and deal-products via the Pipedrive REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/integrations-hub/predefined-tools/workflow).
