## Overview

Phinite's **Google Cloud** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Google Cloud APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Google Cloud Platform resources — Compute Engine VMs, Cloud Storage buckets and objects, Cloud SQL instances, Pub/Sub topics, and Firestore documents via GCP REST APIs.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
</Note>

## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

## Required credentials

- Access Token `access_token` (required)
- Project ID `project_id` (required)
- Default Region `region` (optional)
- Default Zone `zone` (optional)

## Setup steps

1. Create a GCP project, enable required APIs, create OAuth credentials or service account, and obtain an access token with cloud-platform scope.
2. Log into your Phinite workspace at app.phinite.ai
3. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Predefined tools**
4. Select **Google Cloud**
5. Click **+ Add Configuration**
6. Enter the credential fields listed above
7. Select assistants that should use this connection
8. Click **Save Configuration**

## Configure in Graph Studio

1. Open an agent in Graph Studio
2. Select the agent node → **Tools** tab → **Add a new tool**
3. Choose **GoogleCloudTool** (or search for Google Cloud)
4. Select your saved connection or add a new one
5. Enable the subtools your workflow needs and save

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
