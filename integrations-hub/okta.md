## Overview

Phinite's **Okta** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Okta APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Okta users, groups, applications, user lifecycle, and system log events via the Okta Management API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

## Required credentials

- Okta Domain `domain` (required)
- SSWS API Token `api_token` (optional)
- OAuth Bearer Token `access_token` (optional)
- Token Type `token_type` (optional)

## Setup steps

1. In the Okta Admin Console go to **Security → API → Tokens** and create an SSWS API token.
2. Copy your Okta domain (e.g. `dev-123456.okta.com`).
3. Log into your Phinite workspace at app.phinite.ai
4. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Predefined tools**
5. Select **Okta**
6. Click **+ Add Configuration**
7. Enter the credential fields listed above
8. Select assistants that should use this connection
9. Click **Save Configuration**

## Configure in Graph Studio

1. Open an agent in Graph Studio
2. Select the agent node → **Tools** tab → **Add a new tool**
3. Choose **OktaTool** (or search for Okta)
4. Select your saved connection or add a new one
5. Enable the subtools your workflow needs and save

## Predefined tools

Phinite provides 28 subtools for Okta:

- Create User: Creates a new Okta user. By default the user is activated immediately and gains access to assigned applications.
- Get User: Returns a user by ID, login (email), or short name. Includes profile, credentials metadata, and status.
- List Users: Lists users in the organization. Supports filtering and search.
- Update User: Updates a user's profile fields. Only the fields you provide are changed (partial update).
- Delete User: Permanently deletes a deactivated user. The user must be deactivated first.
- Activate User: Activates a user. Sends an activation email by default. Returns an activation token if send_email=false.
- Deactivate User: Deactivates a user, blocking all access. Required before delete_user.
- Suspend User: Suspends an ACTIVE user. Suspended users cannot sign in. The account is preserved and can be unsuspended.
- Unsuspend User: Restores a SUSPENDED user to ACTIVE status.
- Unlock User: Unlocks a LOCKED_OUT user, restoring their ability to sign in.
- Reset User Password: Generates a one-time password reset link for the user. Optionally sends it by email.
- Expire User Password: Expires a user's password, requiring them to set a new one on next sign-in.
- List User Groups: Returns all groups the user is a member of.
- List User Apps: Returns all applications assigned to the user.
- List Groups: Lists groups in the organization.
- Get Group: Returns a group by ID.
- Create Group: Creates a new OKTA_GROUP (manually managed group).
- Update Group: Updates a group's name or description.
- Delete Group: Deletes an OKTA_GROUP. Cannot delete APP_GROUP or BUILT_IN groups.
- List Group Members: Returns all users who are members of the group.
- Add User To Group: Adds a user to an OKTA_GROUP.
- Remove User From Group: Removes a user from an OKTA_GROUP.
- List Apps: Lists applications in the organization.
- Get App: Returns an application by ID including its settings, features, and sign-on configuration.
- List App Users: Returns all users assigned to an application.
- Assign User To App: Assigns a user to an application. Optionally sets app-specific profile and credentials.
- Remove User From App: Removes (unassigns) a user from an application.
- List Events: Queries the Okta System Log for audit events (sign-ins, user changes, policy triggers, etc.).

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
