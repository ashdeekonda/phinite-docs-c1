## Overview

Phinite's **Microsoft Teams** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Microsoft Teams APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Microsoft Teams teams, channels, messages, chats, members, online meetings, and Planner tasks via the Microsoft Graph API.

Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).
