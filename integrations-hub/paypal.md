## Overview

Phinite's **PayPal** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call PayPal APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage PayPal operations — orders, payouts, invoices, products, billing plans, and subscriptions via the PayPal REST API.

Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
