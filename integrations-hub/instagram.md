## Overview

Phinite's **Instagram** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Instagram APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage an Instagram Business or Creator account — profile, media publishing, comments, insights, hashtags, stories, and business discovery via the Instagram Graph API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).
