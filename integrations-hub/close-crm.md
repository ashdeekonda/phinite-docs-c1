## Overview

Phinite's **Close CRM** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Close CRM APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage a Close CRM account — leads, contacts, opportunities, tasks, and activities (notes, calls, emails, SMS, meetings), plus statuses, users, custom fields, pipelines, and smart views — via the Close REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
