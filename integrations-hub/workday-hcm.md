## Overview

Phinite's **Workday HCM** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Workday HCM APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Access Workday HCM data — workers, organizations, job profiles, positions, locations, time off, and business titles via the Workday REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in DevStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
