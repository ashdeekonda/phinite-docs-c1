## Overview

Phinite's **Azure Cosmos DB** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Azure Cosmos DB APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Azure Cosmos DB containers and items (documents) via the Cosmos DB REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

## Required credentials

- Tenant ID `tenant_id` (required)
- Client ID `client_id` (required)
- Client Secret `client_secret` (required)
- Account Name `account_name` (required)
- Database Name `database_name` (required)

## Setup steps

1. Create an Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure Portal.
2. Copy the account endpoint and primary key from **Keys**.
3. Log into your Phinite workspace at app.phinite.ai
4. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Predefined tools**
5. Select **Azure Cosmos DB**
6. Click **+ Add Configuration**
7. Enter the credential fields listed above
8. Select assistants that should use this connection
9. Click **Save Configuration**

## Configure in Graph Studio

1. Open an agent in Graph Studio
2. Select the agent node → **Tools** tab → **Add a new tool**
3. Choose **AzureCosmosDbTool** (or search for Azure Cosmos DB)
4. Select your saved connection or add a new one
5. Enable the subtools your workflow needs and save

## Predefined tools

Phinite provides 10 subtools for Azure Cosmos DB:

- Create Container: Creates a new container (collection) in the Cosmos DB database. Requires a container ID and partition key path.
- Delete Container: Deletes a container and ALL its items. Irreversible.
- Get Container: Returns the properties of a Cosmos DB container including partition key, indexing policy, and throughput.
- List Containers: Lists all containers in the Cosmos DB database.
- Create Item: Creates a new item (document) in a container. The item body must include the partition key field.
- Delete Item: Deletes an item from a container by its ID and partition key value.
- Get Item: Returns a single item from a container by its ID and partition key value.
- List Items: Lists all items in a container. For large containers, use query_items with a filter instead.
- Query Items: Executes a SQL query against a container and returns matching items. Supports parameterized queries.
- Update Item: Replaces an existing item (full replace/upsert). The item body must include the id and partition key field.

## Documentation & resources

- Official documentation: `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/`
- Phinite documentation: [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.phinite.ai/docs/integrations-hub/azure-cosmos-db)

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
