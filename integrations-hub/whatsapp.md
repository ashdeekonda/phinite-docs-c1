## Overview

Phinite's **WhatsApp** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call WhatsApp APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Send WhatsApp messages (text, media, location, contacts, reactions, interactive messages, templates) and manage media via the WhatsApp Business Cloud API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
