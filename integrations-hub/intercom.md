## Overview

Phinite's **Intercom** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Intercom APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Intercom contacts, companies, conversations, notes, tags, admins, and help-center articles via the Intercom REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
