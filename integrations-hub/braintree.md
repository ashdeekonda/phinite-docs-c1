## Overview

Phinite's **Braintree** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Braintree APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Interact with the Braintree (PayPal) GraphQL API — run GraphQL queries/mutations plus convenience operations for transactions and customers.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

## Required credentials

- Public Key `public_key` (required)
- Private Key `private_key` (required)
- Environment `environment` (optional)

## Setup steps

1. Create a Braintree sandbox account at braintreepayments.com.

## Predefined tools

Phinite provides 7 subtools for Braintree:

- Execute Graphql: Run an arbitrary Braintree GraphQL query or mutation with optional variables.
- Ping: Connectivity/auth check (GraphQL ping).
- Create Transaction: Charge a stored payment method. Requires payment_method_id and amount.
- Find Transaction: Fetch a transaction by its node id.
- Refund Transaction: Refund a settled transaction. Optionally provide a partial amount.
- Create Customer: Create a customer. Pass an input object (firstName, lastName, email, ...).
- Find Customer: Fetch a customer by its node id.

## Documentation & resources

- Official documentation: `https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs`
- Phinite documentation: [Braintree](https://docs.phinite.ai/docs/integrations-hub/braintree)

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
