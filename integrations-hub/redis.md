## Overview

Phinite's **Redis** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Redis APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Run Redis operations — strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, pub/sub, TTL management, and server info via the Redis protocol.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

## Required credentials

- Redis URL `url` (optional)
- Host `host` (optional)
- Port `port` (optional)
- Password `password` (optional)
- Database Index `db` (optional)
- Enable SSL `ssl` (optional)

## Setup steps

1. Deploy Redis or use a managed instance and note host, port, password, and database index.
2. Enable TLS if your provider requires it.
3. Log into your Phinite workspace at app.phinite.ai
4. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Predefined tools**
5. Select **Redis**
6. Click **+ Add Configuration**
7. Enter the credential fields listed above
8. Select assistants that should use this connection
9. Click **Save Configuration**

## Configure in Graph Studio

1. Open an agent in Graph Studio
2. Select the agent node → **Tools** tab → **Add a new tool**
3. Choose **RedisTool** (or search for Redis)
4. Select your saved connection or add a new one
5. Enable the subtools your workflow needs and save

## Predefined tools

Phinite provides 43 subtools for Redis:

- Get Value: Gets the value of a key. Automatically detects type and returns the full value.
- Set Value: Sets the value of a key. Supports string, hash, list, and set types.
- Delete Key: Deletes one or more keys from Redis. Returns the number of keys actually deleted.
- Exists Key: Returns the number of the given keys that exist in Redis.
- Get Type: Returns the data type of the value stored at a key.
- Rename Key: Renames a key. If the new name already exists, it is overwritten.
- Get Keys: Returns all keys matching a glob-style pattern. Avoid on large databases.
- Scan Keys: Iterates keys matching a pattern using SCAN (cursor-based, non-blocking).
- Mget: Gets the values of multiple string keys in a single call.
- Mset: Sets multiple string keys to their values in a single atomic operation.
- Expire: Sets a TTL on a key so it is automatically deleted after the given number of seconds.
- Get Ttl: Returns the remaining TTL of a key in seconds.
- Persist: Removes the TTL from a key, making it persist indefinitely.
- Increment: Atomically increments a key's integer value by 1.
- Increment By: Atomically increments a key's integer value by the specified amount.
- Increment Float: Atomically increments a key's floating-point value by the specified amount.
- Decrement: Atomically decrements a key's integer value by 1.
- Decrement By: Atomically decrements a key's integer value by the specified amount.
- List Push: Pushes one or more values onto a Redis list. Pushes to the head by default; set tail=true for RPUSH.
- List Pop: Pops and returns one value from a Redis list. Pops from head by default; set tail=true for RPOP.
- List Length: Returns the number of elements in a Redis list.
- List Range: Returns a range of elements from a Redis list. Index 0 is first; -1 is last.
- Hash Get: Gets the value of a specific field in a hash, or multiple fields at once.
- Hash Set: Sets one or more fields in a hash. Creates the hash if it does not exist.
- Hash Get All: Returns all fields and values of a hash as a dict.
- Hash Delete: Deletes one or more fields from a hash. Returns the number of fields removed.
- Hash Keys: Returns all field names in a hash.
- Hash Increment: Increments the integer or float value of a hash field by the given amount.
- Set Add: Adds one or more members to a Redis set. Returns the number actually added.
- Set Remove: Removes one or more members from a Redis set. Returns the number removed.
- Set Members: Returns all members of a Redis set.
- Set Is Member: Returns true if the specified member exists in a Redis set.
- Zset Add: Adds one or more members with their scores to a sorted set.
- Zset Remove: Removes one or more members from a sorted set.
- Zset Range: Returns members of a sorted set within the given rank range, ordered by score.
- Zset Score: Returns the score of a member in a sorted set.
- Zset Rank: Returns the rank (0-indexed) of a member in a sorted set, ordered by score ascending.
- Zset Count: Returns the number of members in a sorted set with scores between min and max (inclusive).
- Publish Message: Publishes a message to a Redis channel. Returns the number of clients that received it.
- Get Info: Returns server information and statistics, optionally for a specific section.
- Ping: Pings the Redis server to verify the connection is alive. Returns PONG on success.
- Db Size: Returns the total number of keys in the currently selected Redis database.
- Flush Db: Deletes all keys in the currently selected database. Irreversible.

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
