## Overview

Phinite's **ShipStation** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call ShipStation APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage ShipStation shipping and fulfillment — orders, shipments and labels, carriers, products, customers, warehouses, stores, and fulfillments via the ShipStation V1 API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).

- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
