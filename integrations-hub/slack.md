## Overview

Phinite's **Slack** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Slack APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Send and manage Slack messages, reactions, channels, users, scheduled messages, and pins via the Slack Web API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).

- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
