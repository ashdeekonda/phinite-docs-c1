## Overview

Phinite's **Kustomer** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Kustomer APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage a Kustomer account — customers, conversations, messages, notes, tasks, companies, tags, teams, users, and shortcuts — via the Kustomer API v1.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
