## Overview

Phinite's **Google Meet** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Google Meet APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Google Meet spaces, conference records, participants, recordings, and transcripts via the Google Meet REST API v2.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
