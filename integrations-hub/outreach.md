## Overview

Phinite's **Outreach** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Outreach APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Outreach.io sales-engagement resources — prospects, accounts, sequences, sequence enrollments, mailboxes, tasks, calls, and users — via the Outreach REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
