## Overview

Phinite's **Chargebee** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Chargebee APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Chargebee billing — customers, subscriptions, invoices, transactions, credit notes, and the product catalog (items / item prices) — via the Chargebee API v2.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).
