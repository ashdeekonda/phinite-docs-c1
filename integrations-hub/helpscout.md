## Overview

Phinite's **Help Scout** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Help Scout APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Help Scout Mailbox support resources — conversations, threads, customers, mailboxes, users, and tags — via the Help Scout Mailbox API v2. Authenticate with an access token, or client_id + client_secret.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
