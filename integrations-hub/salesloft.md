## Overview

Phinite's **Salesloft** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Salesloft APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Salesloft sales-engagement data — people, accounts, cadences and memberships, users, notes, tasks, calls, email templates, email activity, successes, and stages — via the Salesloft v2 API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
