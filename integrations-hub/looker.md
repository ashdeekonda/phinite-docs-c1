## Overview

Phinite's **Looker** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Looker APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Query Looker data, manage Looks, dashboards, folders, users, and scheduled plans on a Looker BI instance via the Looker REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined tools in Integrations](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).

## Predefined tools

Phinite provides 20 subtools for Looker:

- Run Inline Query: Run an inline query by specifying model, view, fields, filters, sorts, limit. Returns data in the requested format (json, csv, sql, etc.).
- Run Query: Run a previously saved query by its ID. Returns data in the requested format.

- Get Query: Get a query definition by ID.
- Search Looks: Search for Looks. Supports wildcard '%' matching on title. Returns array of Look objects.
- Get Look: Get detailed information about a Look and its associated query.
- Run Look: Run a Look's query and return results in the requested format.
- Create Look: Create a new Look. First create a query with create_query, then pass the query_id here.
- Delete Look: Permanently delete a Look.
- Search Dashboards: Search for dashboards. Supports wildcard '%' matching on title.
- Get Dashboard: Get detailed information about a dashboard including its elements, filters, and layout.
- Create Dashboard: Create a new dashboard.
- Delete Dashboard: Permanently delete a dashboard.
- Search Folders: Search for folders. Supports wildcard '%' matching on name.
- Get Folder: Get a folder by ID including its child count and metadata.

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
