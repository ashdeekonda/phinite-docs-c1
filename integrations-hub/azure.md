## Overview

Phinite's **Azure** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Azure APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage Azure resources via the Azure Resource Manager REST API — subscriptions, resource groups, virtual machines, storage accounts, and App Services.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/devstudio/prebuilt-tools).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

## Required credentials

- Tenant ID `tenant_id` (required)
- Client ID `client_id` (required)
- Client Secret `client_secret` (required)
- Subscription ID `subscription_id` (optional)

## Setup steps

1. Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID and create a client secret or certificate.
2. Grant the application access to the Azure resources you need and obtain an access token.
3. Copy subscription ID, tenant ID, and client credentials into Phinite.
4. Log into your Phinite workspace at app.phinite.ai
5. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Predefined tools**
6. Select **Azure**
7. Click **+ Add Configuration**
8. Enter the credential fields listed above
9. Select assistants that should use this connection
10. Click **Save Configuration**

## Configure in Graph Studio

1. Open an agent in Graph Studio
2. Select the agent node → **Tools** tab → **Add a new tool**
3. Choose **AzureTool** (or search for Azure)
4. Select your saved connection or add a new one
5. Enable the subtools your workflow needs and save

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
