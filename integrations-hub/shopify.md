## Overview

Phinite's **Shopify** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Shopify APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage a Shopify store — create, update, and retrieve products, orders, and customers via the Shopify Admin REST API.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).
