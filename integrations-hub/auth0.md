## Overview

Phinite's **Auth0** predefined tool lets workspace assistants call Auth0 APIs through DevStudio after you save a connection under **Integrations → Predefined tools**.

Manage an Auth0 tenant via the Management API v2 — users, roles, user blocks, applications, connections, organizations, logs, and verification tickets.

<Note>
Predefined tools require a saved connection before they appear in Graph Studio's tool picker. See [Predefined Tools in GraphStudio](/Graphstudio/Tools/Integrations).
</Note>
## What this integration enables

- Automate workflows using this predefined tool from agent graphs
- Connect once under Integrations and reuse across assistants
- Enable individual subtools per agent in Graph Studio

## Required credentials

- Tenant Domain `domain` (required)
- Management API Access Token `access_token` (required)

## Setup steps

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard open your tenant and go to **Applications → APIs → Auth0 Management API**.
2. Authorize a Machine-to-Machine application and copy a Management API access token.
3. Save your tenant domain (e.g. `your-tenant.auth0.com`).
4. Log into your Phinite workspace at app.phinite.ai
5. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Predefined tools**
6. Select **Auth0**
7. Click **+ Add Configuration**
8. Enter the credential fields listed above
9. Select assistants that should use this connection
10. Click **Save Configuration**

## Configure in Graph Studio

1. Open an agent in Graph Studio
2. Select the agent node → **Tools** tab → **Add a new tool**
3. Choose **Auth0Tool** (or search for Auth0)
4. Select your saved connection or add a new one
5. Enable the subtools your workflow needs and save

## Notes

- Store API keys and tokens securely; many providers show secrets only once
- Use separate connections for Dev, UAT, and Prod environments where possible
- Test with a minimal subtool call after saving credentials
