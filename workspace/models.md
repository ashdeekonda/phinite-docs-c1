description: Models hub — Custom Models (BYOM) and Model Keys (BYOK) for agent nodes.
---

**Models** in the workspace sidebar groups two related surfaces:

| Child | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Custom Models** | BYOM — your own model endpoints ([Custom Models](/workspace/custom-models)) |
| **Model Keys** | BYOK — provider keys for catalog models, plus **Phinite Key** |

</Frame>

## Model Keys (BYOK)

**Model Keys** let you bring your own provider credentials (BYOK) or use the platform **Phinite Key**. **Master Agent** and **Child Agent** nodes select which model and key to use for LLM calls on the **Agent Graph**.

<Note>
  **Save** the Agent Graph before **Build** after changing model or key on a node. Permission: `workspace.sidebar.byok`.
</Note>

### Where in the product

| Surface | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace **Models** accordion | **Model Keys** |
| URL | `/{org}/workspace/{workspaceId}/model-key` |
| Per-node model | Graph Studio → agent node drawer → **Change model** |

### Workspace keys

1. Open **BUILD → Models → Model Keys** (or **Keys** if your nav still lists Model Keys there).
2. Add a provider key or use the default **Phinite Key** card.
3. Set which key is default for the workspace if prompted.

### Use on an agent node

1. Open **Graph Studio** and select a **Master Agent** or **Child Agent** node.
2. On **Details**, open **Change model**.
3. Leave **Bring your Own(Custom)** off to use Phinite credentials, or turn it on and choose **Bring your own Key** for BYOK.
4. Pick model and key, then **Done**.
5. **Save** the **Agent Graph** before **Build**.

<Info>
  The **Phinite Key** uses platform-managed credentials. BYOK keys are stored per workspace and never embedded in the graph JSON. For endpoints outside the catalog, use [Custom Models](/workspace/custom-models) (**Bring your own Model**).
</Info>

## Custom Models (BYOM)

See [Custom Models](/workspace/custom-models) for adding endpoints and the public Agent Card restriction on BYOM graphs.
