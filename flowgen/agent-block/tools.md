## Selecting tools

- Choose tools in the Inspector Details tab for the agent.
- Map inputs from variables; outputs become available downstream.
- Predefined tools may expose sub-tools you can select individually.

<Info>
Tool lists are loaded from your workspace; predefined tools expose sub-tools that can be selected independently.
