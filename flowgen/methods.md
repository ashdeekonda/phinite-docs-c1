## Overview

You can create workflows in two ways: a prompt-based Copilot that generates a first draft from natural language, and a manual canvas method for precise control.

## Choosing a method

- **Use Copilot** to rapidly draft a flow from a problem statement or user journey.
- **Use Manual** when you need deterministic structure, fine-grained variables, or specific tool orchestration.
