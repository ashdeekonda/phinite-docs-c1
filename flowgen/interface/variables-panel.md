## Managing variables

Variables are configured in the Inspectorâ€™s Variables tab:

- **Input Variables**: select from available values across the flow
- **Capture Variables**: define what the agent should extract or persist

<Note>
Child Agent variables are managed via `ChildVariables` to support nested/reusable agents.
