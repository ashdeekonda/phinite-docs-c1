## Workflow creation on the canvas

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new flow">
  Open Flowgen Studio and choose "Create manually".
</Step>

<Step title="Add blocks">
  Drag blocks from the Block Library: Start, Master Agent, Child Agent, Tool, End.
</Step>

<Step title="Connect with edges">
  Connect source and target handles between blocks to define execution order.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure blocks">
  Select a block to edit its properties in the Inspector: prompts, RAG, tools, and variables.
</Step>

<Step title="Test and iterate">
  Run sample inputs, observe outputs, and refine prompts, variables, and edge conditions.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use variables to avoid re-computing values and to pass context across agents and tools.
</Tip>
