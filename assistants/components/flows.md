## Overview

![Flows Pn](/Ne-flow.png)

Flows are designed and maintained in [Flowgen Studio](/flowgen/overview). Assistants execute flows to deliver outcomes.

## Key concepts

- Blocks: Start, Agent, Tool, End
- RAG and Tools within Agent blocks
- Variables and Conditional Edges

## Best practices

- Keep flows modular
- Reuse Child Agents for common patterns
- Use variables consistently for data passing
