# Assistants

Assistants are the core of Phinite. Everything revolves around them.\
They are intelligent, multi-skilled entities that automate conversations, workflows, and business operations across channels.

An **Assistant** brings together multiple components ‚Äî **Flows, Intents, Triggers, Tools, Environments, Builds, and Copilot** ‚Äî to function as a cohesive unit.\
Each component plays a distinct role in defining how the Assistant behaves, interacts, and executes tasks.

### Types of Assistants

An assistant is an AI-powered capability that handles user interactions or background tasks using your workflows and tools.

- **Conversational Assistants**: Chat and voice experiences
- **Email Assistants**: Inbox automation for triage and replies
- **Autonomous Assistants**: Scheduled or event-driven background jobs

| Type           | Best for                   | Triggers             | Channels                                |
| :------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Conversational | Real-time chat/voice       | Intents, chat events | Web Chat, WhatsApp, Slack/Teams, Twilio |
| Email          | Asynchronous communication | Inbound email        | Email                                   |

## üß© Core Architecture

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Flows" icon="FlowArrow">
    The heart of the Assistant ‚Äî a visual workflow created in **Flowgen Studio**.\
    Flows connect intents, triggers, and tools to define your automation logic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intents" icon="ChatText">
    Natural language or programmatic cues that tell the Assistant _what the user wants_.\
    Each intent can be AI-generated and linked to a specific flow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Triggers" icon="hand-pointing">
    Event-driven or scheduled conditions that start a workflow automatically.\
    They can originate from APIs, system events, or predefined schedules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trigger Intents" icon="PlugZap">
    Hybrid initiators that combine intent detection with trigger logic.\
    Ideal for scenarios where a user action and a system signal both control flow initiation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tools" icon="Wrench">
    Reusable building blocks maintained by developers in **DevStudio**.\
    They perform API calls, logic processing, or data transformations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environments" icon="Server">
    Isolated spaces for development, testing, and production deployment.\
    Each environment controls visibility, access, and execution logs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Builds" icon="Hammer">
    Snapshot versions of an Assistant. Builds preserve dependencies, flows, and configurations across environments for controlled release and rollback.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Copilot" icon="Sparkles">
    AI-powered assistant that helps you generate flows, intents, and triggers in minutes.\
    It understands context and recommends workflow blocks intelligently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How an Assistant Works

Each Assistant operates as a closed loop of logic and action.

1. **Trigger or Intent fires**
   - Initiates a **Flow**.
2. **Flow executes**
   - Moves across blocks ‚Äî Agent, Tool, Logic, or Connector.
3. **Tools perform operations**
   - API calls, data validation, transformations.
4. **Responses return to the user or system**
   - Completing the workflow cycle.
5. **Logs and observability**
   - All executions are tracked under the **Environment** dashboard.

## üí° Creating an Assistant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Assistants ‚Üí Create Assistant">
    Navigate to your workspace and select **Create Assistant**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Type">
    Choose between **Conversational**, **Autonomous**, or **System Triggered** assistants.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design Flows">
    Open **Flowgen Studio** to visually create the workflow using blocks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link Intents or Triggers">
    Each flow must be linked to a **Trigger** or **Intent** to define its entry point.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach Tools">
    Add logic or data connectors from **DevStudio**‚Äôs tool library.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Environments">
    Assign environment settings for Dev, UAT, or Production.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build and Deploy">
    Finalize and publish the Assistant as a versioned build.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## ü§ñ Copilot

Copilot accelerates assistant creation by generating flows, intents, and triggers using natural language.

### Usage

- Ask: _‚ÄúCreate a flow to schedule a site visit and confirm via email.‚Äù_
- Copilot will suggest the structure, tool connections, and agent messages.
- You can edit or refine before deploying.

<Note>
  Copilot understands workspace context, available tools, and prior builds.\
  It‚Äôs ideal for quickly iterating complex workflows.
</Note>

## üß≠ Summary

Assistants in Phinite unify conversation, automation, and integration into a single, agentic architecture.\
They connect human intent with machine precision ‚Äî through flows, tools, and triggers ‚Äî to deliver intelligent, observable, and scalable outcomes.

<Note>
  Everything in Phinite starts and ends with an Assistant.\
  Design it well ‚Äî and every automation across your workspace becomes effortless.
