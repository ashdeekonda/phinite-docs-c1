## What is an assistant?

</Frame>

An assistant is an AI-powered capability that handles user interactions or background tasks using your workflows and tools.

- **Conversational Assistants**: Chat and voice experiences
- **Email Assistants**: Inbox automation for triage and replies
- **Autonomous Assistants**: Scheduled or event-driven background jobs

## How assistants work

- Assistants are powered by [Flows](/assistants/components/flows)
- Assistants call [Tools](/assistants/components/tools) to act
- Intents and triggers start the interaction
- Builds and environments control where they run
