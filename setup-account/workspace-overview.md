A Workspace is a contained environment where your team designs, builds, and deploys agents.

## Structure

**Organization** → **Workspaces** → **Projects** → **Assets (Flows, Tools, Assistants)**

Default Behavior •	Free Tier: 1 workspace auto-created on sign-up. •	Pro Plan: Up to 3 workspaces. •	Enterprise: Unlimited workspaces, isolated by environment and project.

Inside a Workspace

Each workspace includes: •	FlowGen Studio: Visual designer for agent workflows. •	DevStudio: Tool & integration builder. •	Datasources: Document collections and RAG knowledge bases. •	Environments: Separate runtime spaces (Dev / UAT / Prod). •	Observability: Logs, sessions, and metrics.

Workspaces can be renamed, cloned, or archived by Admins or Super Admins.
