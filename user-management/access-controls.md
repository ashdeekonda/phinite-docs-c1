## Role-based access

Permissions apply **per workspace** through [user roles](/user-management/user-roles). This is workspace **RBAC**—not [Agent Card](/agent-registry/overview) registry identity or external agent authentication.

<Note>
  Granting someone **Developer** on a workspace lets them edit Agent Graphs and tools. It does **not** create or expose an Agent Card on the public registry.
</Note>

## Sign-in and sessions

- You stay signed in while your session is valid; when it expires, sign in again.
- If you can’t reach a page you expect, your administrator may need to adjust your access.

## Best practices

- Grant people the **least access** they need for their job.
- Separate **development**, **test**, and **production** access when your organization uses multiple environments.
- Review **who has access** after role changes or when someone leaves the team.
