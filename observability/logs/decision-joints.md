title: "Decision Joints & Exceptions"
description: "Analyze branching decisions and exceptions in Agent Graph runs."
---

Decision joints explain **why** a graph took a particular edge; exception entries capture tool and node failures.

## Decision analysis

- Which conditional edge fired and which variables influenced it
- Inputs present at the branch point

## Exception tracking

- Error messages and stack traces from tools or nodes
- Correlation with integration credentials or env misconfiguration

<Note>
  Decision logs reflect graph design in [Graph Studio](/graph-studio/overview). They do not evaluate workspace RBAC permissions.
