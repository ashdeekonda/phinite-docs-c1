title: "Session Count"
description: "Track number of sessions by Agent Graph, channel, and environment."
---

Session count measures how often deployed Agent Graphs are invoked over time.

## Dimensions

| Dimension | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent Graph** | Graph that served the session |
| **Channel** | Webchat, Slack, API, telephony, etc. |
| **Environment** | DEV, UAT, or PROD assignment |
| **Time** | Hourly, daily, weekly rollups |

## Use cases

- Monitor adoption after a channel deploy
- Capacity planning for peak traffic
- Anomaly detection when counts diverge from baselines

<Note>
  A **session** is one end-user or API invocation of a deployed graph—not a Graph Studio edit session.
