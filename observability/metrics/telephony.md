title: "Telephony Metrics"
description: "Track calls, durations, and call quality for voice-enabled Agent Graph channels."
---

Telephony metrics apply when Agent Graphs serve **voice channels** (for example Twilio-backed flows).

## Metrics

| Metric | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Call count** | Inbound/outbound sessions |
| **Duration** | Talk time and hold patterns |
| **Drop rate** | Abandoned or failed calls |
| **ASR / latency** | Speech recognition accuracy and responsiveness |

## Use cases

- Voice quality monitoring after model or prompt changes
- Vendor or trunk comparison
- Capacity planning for contact-center peaks

<Note>
  Telephony metrics attach to **Agent Graph** voice deploys. Email or chat-only graphs will not populate these series.
