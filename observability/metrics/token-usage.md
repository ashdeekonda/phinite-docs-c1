title: "Token Usage (LLM, STT, TTS)"
description: "Measure token consumption across language, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech for Agent Graph runs."
---

Token metrics break down model and speech service usage during Agent Graph execution.

## Dimensions

| Dimension | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Model** | LLM or speech model identifier |
| **Agent Graph** | Graph consuming tokens |
| **Environment** | DEV / UAT / PROD |
| **Channel** | Surface driving the run |
| **Time** | Trend windows |

## Use cases

- Cost monitoring and [billing](/observability/billing) allocation
- Model selection and prompt/tool optimization
- Budget alerts before Prod traffic spikes

<Tip>
  Compare token usage before and after prompt or tool changes on the same graph version filter.
