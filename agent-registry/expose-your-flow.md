title: Expose your Agent Graph as an A2A agent
description: Register a published Agent Build in the Agent Registry using Deploy as A2A and attach an Agent Card.
---

<Note>
  **Deploy as A2A** exposes an **Agent Build** with an **Agent Card** — the agent's public identity. Create a **Build** before opening the deploy wizard (**Deploy** stays disabled until one exists).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you expose an Agent Graph:

1. **Save** the graph and create at least one **Agent Build** ([Builds overview](/builds/overview)).
2. Hold **Developer** role or higher for Graph Studio save/build actions.
3. Have permission to call registry APIs (`assistants.flows:create` via gateway **`POST /a2a-registry`**).
4. **Publish** any tools referenced by the graph — unpublished tools show **Publish** in the build step.

## Open the expose flow

1. Open **Graph Studio** for the Agent Graph.
2. Click **Deploy** — the **Deploy Agent Build** modal opens.
3. **Select a Build** (immutable snapshot of graph + tools).
4. Choose **Deploy as A2A** (other tabs: **Deploy to Channel**, **Deploy as Chat API**).
5. Review the three-step A2A path shown in the modal, then **Continue to A2A with Build N**.
6. Existing LIVE / TEST endpoints for this agent appear at the bottom of the modal when already registered.

### What Deploy as A2A does

| Step | UI copy |
| --- | --- |
| 01 | **Publish the agent card** — package this build's dependencies and agent card |
| 02 | **Share the hosted URL** — callers reach it at a URL like `…/a2a/{flow}/build-{n}` |
| 03 | **Callers invoke it** — other agents and clients send requests over the A2A protocol |

You can also open graph-scoped cards from Studio → **Agent Cards** under Graph assets.

</Frame>

Use **Create New Build** in the deploy modal when you need a fresh snapshot before exposing.

## Wizard steps (after Continue to A2A)

| Step | Label | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Agent Build Config** | Pick graph version and published tools |
| 2 | **Additional Config** | Optional export of tools/variables to the build |
| 3 | **Configure the Agent card** | Agent Card identity, skills, tags, visibility |

Primary actions: **Next** (steps 1–2), **Attach Agent Card** (step 3).

### Step 1 — Agent Build Config

<Frame caption="Expose wizard — confirm Agent Graph and tool versions">
  <img src="/images/v2/configure/02-build-export.png" alt="Agent Build Config step with graph and tools" />
</Frame>

1. **Agent Graph** accordion — select the saved graph version (name, version number, notes, timestamp).
2. **Tools Associated** accordion — select published tool versions. Unpublished tools show **Publish** inline.
3. Validation requires a selected graph version and at least one published tool when tools exist on the graph.

### Step 2 — Additional Config

1. Toggle **Export value for agent version** to include predefined tools, MCP tools, or env variables in the registry build.
2. When enabled, use tabs **Predefined**, **MCP**, and **Env** — search **Search tools and variables...**
3. For each exported row, provide a **description** (required).

See [Build export configuration](/configure/build-export) for when to export credentials for external callers.

### Step 3 — Configure the Agent Card

Wizard copy: *Agent Card is the identity of your agent on the Internet.*

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent Name** | Read-only; derived from the Agent Graph name |
| **Agent Description** | Editable summary for catalog and A2A clients |
| **Skills** | Unique name, description, **Input Modes**, **Output Modes** (MIME types) |
| **Discoverability Tags** | Search and Discovery filter metadata |
| **Visibility & access** | **Public** — any A2A client with valid API key. **Organisation** — same org only |
| **Auth Schemes** | Platform default: organisation **API key** |
| **Refine Card** | Optional AI refinement for description and skills |

1. Edit fields as needed.
2. Click **Attach Agent Card** — calls **`POST /a2a-registry?workspaceid={workspaceId}`** with wizard payload.

## After registration

On success:

1. Note the **Agent Registry ID** and **hosted A2A URL** (LIVE builds use the short `{flowId}` path — [Endpoints & lifecycle](/agent-registry/endpoints-and-lifecycle)).
2. The build is available to **Test**.
3. Open Studio → **Agent Cards** or the workspace [Agent Registry](/agent-registry/catalog) to inspect the entry.
4. Promote to **`live`** from [Agent Cards](/agent-registry/agent-cards) when ready for production routing.

<Tip>
  One **LIVE** version per Agent Graph per workspace. **Push To Prod** demotes the previous LIVE row to TEST.
