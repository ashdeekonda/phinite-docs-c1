title: A2A endpoints & lifecycle
description: Hosted URL patterns, TEST vs LIVE builds, promotion, authentication, and registry API endpoints.

<Note>
  Always use the **hosted A2A URL** copied from **Agent Registry** or **Agent Cards** — URL host varies by tenant and environment.
</Note>

## Hosted A2A URLs

External callers reach registered agents through the **API gateway** AI-core lane. The frontend builds URLs with the same rules as `buildA2aUrl` in the product:

| Deployment status | URL pattern | Example shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Live** | `{gateway}/api/v1/ai/a2a/{flowId}` | Production routing; registry ID omitted |
| **Test** | `{gateway}/api/v1/ai/a2a/{flowId}/{registryId}` | Validation build tied to a specific registry row |

```text
# Live
https://app-dev.phinite.ai/api/v1/ai/a2a/{flowId}

# Test
https://app-dev.phinite.ai/api/v1/ai/a2a/{flowId}/{a2aregistryid}
```

Replace the host with your environment's gateway base. For local development, paths may appear under `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/ai/a2a/...`.

## Registry lifecycle

Each expose action creates an **A2A registry** row with deployment status **`test`** by default.

| Status | Meaning | Hosted URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`test`** | Internal validation before broad discovery | Includes `{registryId}` in path |
| **`live`** | Production build for the Agent Graph | Short path with `{flowId}` only |

**One LIVE build per Agent Graph per workspace.** Promoting a build to LIVE demotes any previous LIVE row for the same `flowid` back to **`test`**.

### Lifecycle workflow

1. **Expose** — [Deploy as A2A](/agent-registry/expose-your-flow) creates a TEST registry row and Agent Card.
2. **Validate** — call the TEST hosted URL; verify skills and exported tool/env config.
3. **Push To Prod** — `PUT /api/v1/a2a-registry/{a2aregistryid}/promote-live`.
4. Previous LIVE for the same graph demotes to **TEST**.

### Promote to LIVE

From [Agent Cards](/agent-registry/agent-cards), select a TEST build and use **Push To Prod**:

```text
PUT /api/v1/a2a-registry/{a2aregistryid}/promote-live
```

No request body required. Response is the updated registry document with `status: "live"`.

## Visibility and authentication

| Visibility | UI label | Invoke behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`public`** | Public | Callable by any client with a valid Phinite **API key** |
| **`organization`** | Organisation | Callable only when the API key belongs to the **same organisation** |

At runtime, gateway **`A2ARegistryAccess`** middleware validates visibility (e.g. `POST /api/v1/ai/a2a/agents/{registryId}`).

**Auth scheme:** callers use your organisation's **API key** (JWT) in the `X-API-Key` header unless your deployment configures additional schemes.

Integrators consume from the **Agent Card**:

- Name, description, skills (input/output MIME modes)
- Discoverability tags
- Hosted URL (TEST vs LIVE pattern above)

Protocol reference: [A2A specification](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/).

## External clients (Claude Connector)

End users can call registry agents from **Claude** via the [Phinite Connector](/agent-registry/invoke-a2a-from-claude) without constructing A2A URLs manually.

| Layer | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **Connector auth** | User signs in to Phinite when connecting the plugin |
| **Discovery** | `discover_agents` / `list_agents` query the same registry metadata as the workspace catalog |
| **Invocation** | `call_agent` maps to A2A `SendMessage` on `POST /api/v1/ai/a2a/agents/{registryId}` |
| **Multi-turn** | Pass `task_id` from a prior response to continue the same A2A task |
| **Tool credentials** | Missing integration config returns **`TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED`** with a link to **`/public/agent-config`** |

## Registry management API

Base path: **`/api/v1/a2a-registry`**. Requires gateway authentication (session cookie or Bearer / API key).

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/a2a-registry` | List registry rows |
| `GET` | `/a2a-registry/{a2aregistryid}` | Get one row (`?flow=true` includes flow payload) |
| `POST` | `/a2a-registry?workspaceid=...` | Create registration (Expose wizard) |
| `PUT` | `/a2a-registry/{a2aregistryid}` | Update registration |
| `PUT` | `/a2a-registry/{a2aregistryid}/promote-live` | Promote to LIVE |
| `DELETE` | `/a2a-registry/{a2aregistryid}` | Delete registration |

**Permissions:** `assistants.flows:read|create|update|delete` depending on operation.

### Useful list query parameters

| Parameter | Values | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workspaceid` | string | **Required** — scopes to workspace |
| `orgid` | string | Organisation filter |
| `status` | `test`, `live` | Deployment filter |
| `visibility` | `public`, `organization` | Visibility filter |
| `flowid` | string | All builds for one Agent Graph |
| `flow_list=true` | boolean | Distinct flows only (Agent Cards dropdown) |
| `pagination` | `true` / `false` | Paginated vs full list |
