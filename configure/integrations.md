title: Integrations configuration
description: Channels, Integration Tools, and Triggers in the workspace hub and Graph Studio.
---

**Integrations** connect **Agent Graphs** to the outside world: messaging **Channels**, callable **Integration Tools**, and autonomous **Triggers** (API, Cron, background tasks).

Configuration happens in the workspace **Integrations** hub and can be scoped to an **Agent Graph** from Graph Studio.

<Note>
  Configure credentials in **Development** first, validate with a **DEV** build assignment, then promote to UAT and PROD.
</Note>

## Connect a channel

1. Open workspace **Integrations** → **Channels** tab (or sidebar **Channels**).
2. Click **New Integration** / pick a channel type.
3. Complete credential and webhook configuration for **Development** first.
4. In Graph Studio, **Deploy** → **Deploy to Channel** and assign your **Agent Build** ([Deploy to channel](/agents/deploy-channel)).

## Configure a trigger

1. Open **Integrations** → **Triggers** tab.
2. Create **Autonomous** (API / Cron) or **Conversational** trigger as needed.
3. Assign an **Agent Build** to DEV / UAT / PROD on the trigger connection.
4. Copy the webhook URL or cron schedule from the trigger config page.

## Graph Studio shortcut

Graph Studio → **Integrations** submenu lists **Channels** and **Integration Tools** without leaving the canvas. The **Triggers** panel links to **Add trigger in Integrations** when none exist.

<Tip>
  Tools reference **Env. variables** by key name — configure [Env. variables](/configure/env-variables) before wiring channel or trigger credentials.
</Tip>
