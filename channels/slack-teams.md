## Connecting Your Agentic Bot to Slack

This guide will help you connect your AI-powered agentic chatbot with Slack, enabling your bot to send and receive messages directly in your Slack workspace.

Once connected, your bot can:
- Reply to Slack users in real time  
- Send automated updates or alerts  
- Handle customer support directly from Slack  

---

### Step 1: Create a New Slack Configuration

1. Navigate to your website‚Äôs **Integrations ‚Üí Slack** section.  
2. Click **‚ûï Add Configuration** or **New Configuration**.  
3. A new configuration form will open (as shown in the image above).  
4. Fill in the following fields:
   - **SignIn Secret**  
   - **SignIn Bot Token**  
   - *(Optional)* Configuration name  
5. Choose the agent (if applicable) you want to connect from the dropdown menu.  
6. Click **üíæ Save Configuration**.  

Once saved, you‚Äôll see **Webhook URLs** generated for each environment:

- **DEV** ‚Äî Development  
- **UAT** ‚Äî Testing  
- **PROD** ‚Äî Production  

These URLs will be used later inside your Slack App settings.

### Step 2: Create a Slack App

Before you can fill in your SignIn credentials, you need to register a Slack App.

1. Go to [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps).  
2. Click **Create New App ‚Üí From scratch**.  
3. Enter an **App Name** (e.g., *Agentic Chatbot*).  
4. Select the **Workspace** where you want to install the bot.  
5. Click **Create App**.  

You‚Äôve now created a Slack app ‚Äî next, we‚Äôll configure permissions and tokens.

---

### Step 3: Generate the Bot Token

1. In your app‚Äôs left sidebar, go to **OAuth & Permissions**.  
2. Scroll to the **Scopes** section.  
3. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, add the following recommended permissions:

```bash
chat:write
channels:read
channels:history
im:read
im:history
users:read
files:read
files:write
```

*(You can add more scopes depending on your bot‚Äôs features.)*

4. Scroll up and click **Install to Workspace**.  
5. Authorize the app by clicking **Allow**.  
6. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** ‚Äî it starts with `xoxb-...`.  
7. Paste this token into your website‚Äôs **SignIn Bot Token** field.

---

### Step 4: Get Your Signing Secret

1. In your Slack App settings, go to **Basic Information**.  
2. Scroll down to **App Credentials**.  
3. Copy the **Signing Secret**.  
4. Paste it into the **SignIn Secret** field in your website‚Äôs configuration form.

---

### Step 5: Save and Copy the Webhook URL

Once both fields are filled, click **Save Configuration**.

After saving, your integration will generate **Webhook URLs** for each environment:

```bash
DEV: https://api-server-dev.yourdomain.ai/slack/.../development

UAT: https://api-server-dev.yourdomain.ai/slack/.../uat

PROD: https://api-server-dev.yourdomain.ai/slack/.../production
```
---

### Step 6: Connect Your Bot to Slack Events

Now that your app and credentials are ready, you need to link the webhook URL with Slack‚Äôs **Event Subscriptions**.

1. In your Slack App, go to **Event Subscriptions** (under *Features*).  
2. Turn **ON** ‚ÄúEnable Events.‚Äù  
3. Copy the appropriate **Webhook URL** (e.g., *DEV*) from your website.  
4. Paste it into the **Request URL** field in Slack.  
5. Slack will verify the URL automatically.  
6. Once verified, scroll down and click **Save Changes**.

üí° **Note:** Slack allows only one Request URL per app.  
If you‚Äôre testing, use your DEV URL first and switch to PROD when ready.

---

### Optional: Subscribe to Events

Still in **Event Subscriptions**, scroll to **Subscribe to bot events** and add the events your chatbot needs, for example:

```bash
message.channels ‚Üí for public channels
message.im ‚Üí for direct messages
app_mention ‚Üí to respond when mentioned
```

Click **Save Changes**.  

Your chatbot can now listen and respond to these Slack events. üéâ

### Common Issues

**Invalid Request URL:**  
Ensure your webhook URL is publicly accessible (e.g., HTTPS).
