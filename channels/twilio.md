<Note>
  Twilio Voice routes phone calls to a deployed **Agent Build**. Provision a number, point the voice webhook to Phinite, then assign the build via **Deploy to Channel** for **DEV / UAT / PROD**.
</Note>

## Set up Twilio Voice

1. Provision a **Twilio phone number** in your Twilio console.
2. Open workspace **Integrations** → **Channels** → **Twilio** (or voice integration for your tenant).
3. Enter Account SID, Auth Token, and related voice settings.
4. Copy the **DEV** voice webhook URL from the saved Phinite configuration.
5. In Twilio → **Phone Numbers** → your number → **Voice Configuration**, set the webhook URL to **POST** to Phinite's DEV endpoint.
6. **Save** your Conversational Agent Graph and create an **Agent Build**.
7. **Deploy** → **Deploy to Channel** — select Twilio, assign build to **DEV**.
8. Place a test call; review [Observability logs](/observability/logs) and telephony metrics.
9. Promote to **UAT** / **PROD** with matching webhook URLs per environment.

<Tip>
  Design your Agent Graph for DTMF input and speech transcription if your flow collects keypad or spoken responses. Test latency in DEV before production traffic.
