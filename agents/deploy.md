description: Deploy an Agent Build to a channel, Chat API, HTTP trigger, cron, or A2A.
---

After you create an **Agent Build**, use **Deploy** in Graph Studio to route that frozen snapshot to a runtime target. **Deploy** stays disabled until at least one build exists for the Agent Graph.

<Note>
  Golden path: design the graph → **Save** → **Build** → assign an **environment** → **Deploy** to a channel, trigger, or A2A endpoint.

## Deploy targets by graph type

### Conversational Agent Graphs

| Tab | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| **Deploy as A2A** | Agent Card + hosted A2A URL ([Expose your flow](/agent-registry/expose-your-flow)) |
| **Deploy to Channel** | Assign build to a connected channel environment |
| **Deploy as Chat API** | HTTP chat endpoint for backends and apps |

### Autonomous Agent Graphs

| Tab | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| **Deploy as API** | On-demand HTTP webhook trigger |
| **Cron job** | Scheduled runs on the platform |
| **Deploy as A2A** | Coming soon |

<Tip>
  Conversational graphs support **Deploy as A2A** today. Autonomous **Deploy as A2A** may show as coming soon in the Deploy modal — use **Deploy as API** or **Cron job** for autonomous automation.
</Tip>

## Deploy an Agent Build

1. Create an **Agent Build** ([Builds overview](/builds/overview)) — the graph must be **Saved** first.
2. In Graph Studio, click **Deploy** on the toolbar.
3. Choose a tab matching your graph type (channel, Chat API, API, Cron, or A2A).
4. Select the **Agent Build** and target **environment** (start with **DEV**).
5. Complete any in-modal fields (webhook confirmation, schedule, Agent Card identity).
6. If prompted, finish channel or trigger setup in **Integrations** ([Configure integrations](/configure/integrations)).

## Where configuration lives

| Need | Go to |
| --- | --- |
| Channels / triggers hub | Workspace **Integrations** (Tools / Channels / Triggers) |
| Graph-scoped channels | Studio → **Integrations** → Channels |
| Graph-scoped triggers | Studio → **Triggers** |
| Env. variables | Workspace **Env. variables** ([Build environments](/builds/environments)) |
