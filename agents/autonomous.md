**Autonomous Agent Graphs** run without a live user. External systems, schedules, or events start a session; the graph executes tools, routing, and optional registry agent calls in the background.

## What Autonomous graphs do

| Capability | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Webhook ingress** | HTTP API triggers start a graph run on demand |
| **Scheduled runs** | Cron jobs execute graphs on a timetable |
| **Background tasks** | Long-running or queued automation without user sessions |
| **Multi-system orchestration** | Tools, RAG, and registry agent nodes in one graph |
| **Full audit trail** | Every run recorded in [Observability logs](/observability/logs) |

## Trigger types

| Trigger | Use when | Doc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API (webhook)** | External system POSTs a payload to start a run | [Trigger API](/triggers-intents/triggers/api) |
| **Cron** | Runs on a fixed schedule | [Cron triggers](/triggers-intents/triggers/cron) |
| **Background task** | Queued or async execution | [Background task](/triggers-intents/triggers/bg_task) |
| **Event-based** | React to integration events | [Event triggers](/triggers-intents/event-triggers) |

See [Triggers overview](/triggers-intents/triggers/overview) for the full trigger hub.

## Design workflow

1. Create an **Autonomous** Agent Graph from Workspace Home.
2. In Graph Studio, model the automation as nodes — typically **Start** → agent/tool chain → **End**.
3. Attach [tools](/graph-studio/agent-node/tools) for each external action (CRM update, email send, data fetch).
4. Use [variables](/graph-studio/agent-node/variables) to pass trigger payload fields into tool inputs.
5. Click **Save**, then **Build** ([Builds overview](/builds/overview)).
6. Assign the build to **DEV** / **UAT** / **PROD**.
7. Click **Deploy** and choose a target:

| Deploy tab | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| **Deploy as API** | Webhook URL that starts a graph run |
| **Cron job** | Scheduled execution with cron expression |
| **Deploy as A2A** | Expose as Agent Card (coming soon for Autonomous) |

## Deploy an API trigger

1. **Build** and assign your Autonomous graph to the target environment.
2. Click **Deploy** → **Deploy as API**.
3. Select build version and confirm trigger configuration.
4. Copy the webhook URL and authenticate with your workspace API key.
5. POST a JSON payload from your upstream system to start a run.

See [Deploy a trigger](/agents/deploy-trigger) and [Trigger API guide](/triggers-intents/triggers/api-guide).

## Deploy a cron schedule

1. **Build** and assign the graph.
2. Click **Deploy** → **Cron job**.
3. Enter the cron expression and timezone.
4. Select environment and build version.
5. Confirm — Phinite runs the graph on schedule.

See [Cron triggers](/triggers-intents/triggers/cron).

## Best practices

- Design actions to be **idempotent** — triggers may retry or duplicate.
- Return structured outputs and capture variables for downstream auditing.
- Set timeouts and error branches so failed tool calls do not leave silent failures.
- Test with sample payloads in **DEV** before promoting builds to PROD.
- Monitor runs in [Observability](/observability/overview) — there is no user to report errors.

<Warning>
  Autonomous graphs run with production credentials in PROD. Validate env variables and integration auth in UAT first.
</Warning>
