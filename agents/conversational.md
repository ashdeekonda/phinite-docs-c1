description: Design chat and voice Agent Graphs — deploy via channels or Chat API.

**Conversational Agent Graphs** handle real-time chat and voice. Users interact through connected channels or your own apps via the **Chat API** — routing, tools, and RAG logic live in [Graph Studio](/graph-studio/overview).

## What Conversational graphs do

| Capability | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Real-time dialogue** | Multi-turn sessions with memory and captured variables |
| **Channel ingress** | WhatsApp, Slack, Teams, web chat, Twilio Voice, email |
| **Programmatic chat** | Chat API for custom frontends and mobile apps |
| **Knowledge grounding** | RAG collections attached to agent nodes |
| **Observability** | Session logs, timelines, and token metrics |

## Supported channels

| Channel | Doc |
| --- | --- |
| Web Chat | [Web chat](/channels/webchat) |
| WhatsApp | [WhatsApp](/channels/whatsapp) |
| Slack / Teams | [Slack & Teams](/channels/slack-teams) |
| Twilio Voice | [Twilio](/channels/twilio) |
| Email | [Email](/channels/email) |

Configure channel credentials once under workspace **Integrations**, then assign a build during **Deploy to Channel**. See [Channels overview](/channels/overview).

## Design workflow

1. Create a **Conversational** Agent Graph from Workspace Home.
2. In Graph Studio, add **Start**, **Master Agent**, and **End** nodes ([Node types](/graph-studio/nodes)).
3. Configure each agent node's prompt, tools, and RAG ([Agent configuration](/graph-studio/agent-node)).
4. Define [variables](/graph-studio/variables) for inputs the graph should capture across turns.
5. Click **Save**, then **Build** to pin tool versions ([Builds](/builds/overview)).
6. Assign the build to **DEV** / **UAT** / **PROD**.
7. Click **Deploy** and choose a target:

| Deploy tab | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| **Deploy to Channel** | Route inbound messages from a connected channel to this build |
| **Deploy as Chat API** | HTTP endpoint your app calls for chat turns |
| **Deploy as A2A** | Expose as an Agent Card with hosted A2A URL |

<Tip>
  Test in Graph Studio with **Test** before promoting builds to PROD. Use [Observability logs](/observability/logs) to trace conversation paths and refine prompts.
</Tip>

## Deploy via Chat API

When you deploy as **Chat API**, Phinite exposes an HTTP endpoint backed by your pinned build. Your application sends user messages and receives agent responses — no channel webhook required.

1. Create and **Build** your Conversational graph.
2. Click **Deploy** → **Deploy as Chat API**.
3. Select environment and build version.
4. Copy the endpoint URL and authenticate with your workspace API key.
5. Send chat payloads from your backend or mobile app.

See [Deploy](/agents/deploy) and [Reference API](/reference/api) for request formats.

## Deploy via channels

1. Connect the channel under workspace **Integrations** ([Configure integrations](/configure/integrations)).
2. **Build** and assign to the target environment.
3. Click **Deploy** → **Deploy to Channel**.
4. Select channel, environment, and build.
5. Complete webhook or OAuth steps shown in the modal.

See [Deploy to a channel](/agents/deploy-channel) for per-channel details.

## Best practices

- Keep prompts focused — one clear mission per Master Agent node.
- Capture structured variables early so downstream tool nodes have clean inputs.
- Publish and pin tool versions before production builds.
- Monitor session logs for failed tool calls and unexpected routing.
