Excellent — here’s your final, publication-ready “Getting Started” module for Phinite Docs, written in full Mintlify / GitBook style Markdown.

This version unifies the onboarding flow (sign-up, organization setup, verification, plans, adding users, invites, workspaces, access, and limits) — concise, conceptual, and copy-paste-ready.

Getting Started

Overview

Welcome to Phinite — the AI automation platform for building, deploying, and scaling multi-agent workflows across chat, voice, and enterprise systems.

This section walks you through how to get started with your Phinite Organization, create your first Workspace, invite users, and understand plan-specific limits and permissions.

⸻

Create Your Organization

Every Phinite user operates inside an Organization, which defines your workspaces, environments, billing, and user access.
When you sign up for the first time, Phinite automatically creates an organization based on your details.

Sign-Up Form Fields

Field	Description	Example
Organization Name	The name of your company or project.	Acme Labs
Owner Full Name	The full legal name of the account owner or admin.	Jane Doe
Owner Email Address	Used as the login and main contact for the organization.	jane@acmelabs.ai
Password	Secure password for login.	••••••••

After completing the form:
	1.	Verify your email address – check your inbox and confirm.
	2.	Auto-create your organization – Phinite provisions your org and default workspace.
	3.	Access the Admin Dashboard – you are logged in as Super Admin.

Note: All resources, quotas, and billing are tied to the organization, not individual accounts.

Adding Users

Depending on your plan, you can invite team members to collaborate within your organization.

Invite Users
	1.	Go to Admin → User Management.
	2.	Click Invite User.
	3.	Enter the user’s email address and select a Role (Admin, Developer, or Viewer).
	4.	The user receives an email with an invitation link.

Accepting Invites

Invited users receive an email titled “You’ve been invited to join [Org Name] on Phinite”.
Click Accept Invite → set your password → verify your email → access the workspace.

Note: Each invite is valid for 72 hours. Expired invites can be re-issued from the Admin Dashboard.

⸻

Workspaces

A Workspace is a contained environment where your team designs, builds, and deploys agents.

Default Behavior
	•	Free Tier: 1 workspace auto-created on sign-up.
	•	Pro Plan: Up to 3 workspaces.
	•	Enterprise: Unlimited workspaces, isolated by environment and project.

Inside a Workspace

Each workspace includes:
	•	FlowGen Studio: Visual designer for agent workflows.
	•	DevStudio: Tool & integration builder.
	•	Datasources: Document collections and RAG knowledge bases.
	•	Environments: Separate runtime spaces (Dev / UAT / Prod).
	•	Observability: Logs, sessions, and metrics.

Workspaces can be renamed, cloned, or archived by Admins or Super Admins.

⸻

User Access & Roles

Roles define what actions a user can perform inside your organization and its workspaces.

Role	Access Level	Capabilities
Super Admin	Full	Manages organization, billing, environments, users, and assistants.
Admin	Partial	Creates/edit workspaces, assistants, and flows; cannot access billing.
Developer	Limited	Builds and tests flows inside assigned workspaces only.
Viewer / Tester	Read-only	Views logs, sessions, and performance metrics.

Free Tier allows 1 Super Admin only.
Pro and Enterprise plans support multiple roles across multiple workspaces.

Feature Limits & Quotas

Resource usage in Phinite is defined by your plan and environment type.

Resource Type	Measured By	Limit Behavior

Voice Minutes	Call duration	Calls disabled once quota reached

Would you like me to also prepare a “Quick Start Checklist” (like a 7-step visual table) that can sit at the top of this page — for example: “Create Org → Verify Email → Access Dashboard → Add Users → Create Workspace → Build Agent → Deploy”?
That’s a nice onboarding summary block Mintlify readers often appreciate.
