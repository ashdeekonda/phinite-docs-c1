Phinite enables teams to build and deploy **Agent Graphs** securely across channels, triggers, and the [Agent Registry](/agent-registry/overview). Every graph follows the same spine: **Design → Save → Build → Environment → Deploy** (or **Expose as A2A**).

## Conversational Agent Graphs

**Purpose:** Engage users through chat or voice channels with context, retrieval, and multi-step orchestration.

| Capability | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Context | Multi-turn conversations with session memory and captured variables |
| Channels | Web chat, WhatsApp, Slack, Teams, Twilio Voice, email |
| Knowledge | RAG collections grounded in workspace data sources |
| Governance | RBAC-controlled environments, audit logs, and observability |

**Examples:**

- Support or HR FAQ agents
- Appointment schedulers
- Knowledge-grounded internal helpdesks
- Order status and ticket-creation flows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer support and HR">
    Answer FAQs, escalate tickets, and sync outcomes to CRM or Slack using predefined tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Appointment and scheduling">
    Automate booking flows with Google Calendar, HubSpot Meetings, or custom APIs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Knowledge Q&A">
    Ground conversations on internal documents or RAG collections for accurate responses.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Deploy targets:** [Deploy to Channel](/agents/deploy-channel), [Deploy as Chat API](/agents/deploy), [Expose as A2A](/agent-registry/expose-your-flow).

<Note>
  Workspace filters may still show an **Email** chip. New graphs only offer **Conversational** and **Autonomous**.
</Note>

## Autonomous Agent Graphs

**Purpose:** Execute background and cross-system workflows without a live user — triggered by webhooks, schedules, or events.

| Capability | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Orchestration | Visual multi-agent graphs in Graph Studio |
| Triggers | API webhooks, cron jobs, background tasks |
| Composition | [Agent Registry](/agent-registry/overview) for Browse and Discovery agent nodes |
| Governance | Environment-specific credentials, RBAC, and full observability |

**Examples:**

- Data enrichment and validation pipelines
- Compliance evidence collection
- Scheduled report generation
- Monitoring and alerting workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Operations and back office">
    Automate repetitive processes like data enrichment, validation, and reporting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compliance and audit">
    Collect evidence, run validations, and maintain compliance logs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data pipelines">
    Ingest, transform, and publish structured data using external APIs and schedulers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Deploy targets:** [Deploy as API](/agents/deploy-trigger), [Cron job](/triggers-intents/trigger-apis#cron-job-mode), [Expose as A2A](/agent-registry/expose-your-flow) (coming soon for Autonomous).

<Tip>
  Design Autonomous graphs for **idempotent** actions and clear error handling — there is no user in the loop to recover from failures.
</Tip>

## Compare graph types

| Dimension | Conversational | Autonomous |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User present** | Yes — live chat or voice | No — background execution |
| **Primary ingress** | Channel or Chat API | API trigger or Cron |
| **Typical latency** | Real-time (seconds) | Batch or scheduled |
| **Best for** | Support, sales, HR, Q&A | ETL, monitoring, ops automation |
| **Test in Studio** | **Test** chat panel | Trigger test payloads |

## Getting started

1. **Create a workspace** — name it after your department or project.
2. **Add users** — assign roles and permissions ([User roles](/user-management/user-roles)).
3. **Create an Agent Graph** — choose Conversational or Autonomous.
4. **Design in Graph Studio** — nodes, tools, RAG, variables.
5. **Ship securely** — Save, Build, assign DEV/UAT/PROD, then Deploy.
