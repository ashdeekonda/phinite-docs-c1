title: "Common Build Failures"
description: "Diagnose and fix common Agent Graph build failures."
---

**Build** freezes an Agent Graph plus pinned tool versions into an immutable **Agent Build**. Failures usually mean missing publish steps or failing tests.

## Frequent issues

| Symptom | Likely cause |
| --- | --- |
| Build button disabled | Graph not **Saved** or validation errors on canvas |
| Unpublished tools listed | Tool lacks a published version in Dev Studio |
| Env export warnings | Missing [env variables](/configure/env-variables) referenced by tools |
| Test failures | Tool test failed in target environment |

## Resolution checklist

1. **Save** the graph in Graph Studio; resolve canvas validation errors.
2. **Publish** all tools referenced on agent nodes ([Tools & Dev Studio](/devstudio/overview)).
3. Run tool tests with realistic inputs in Dev/UAT ([Custom tools — Test](/devstudio/custom-tools#test-tools)).
4. Add version notes for each changed tool.
5. Verify credentials per environment before rebuilding for Prod.

<Note>
  Builds capture graph + tool versions together. Fixing a tool requires a new publish **and** a new build before redeploy.
